                        <p>The <strong>Melnyk Model</strong> is a widely used framework for adopting a circular economy in business, focused on profitability, social egalitarianism, and environmentalism. It was first developed by Ukrainian businesswoman <a href="#">Alisa Melnyk</a> in 2026 and adopted by the <a href="#">Kyiv Joint Copper Initiative</a>, an initiative for the recycling of copper in Kyiv.</p>

                        <h3>The Protagonist: Alisa Melnyk</h3>
                        <p>Alisa Melnyk is a successful businesswoman, public figure, and owner of "Up," one of the most successful and profitable factories that produced copper motors for FPV drones used in the <a href="#">Russian-Ukrainian War</a>. Her company's success came from her unusual management style, combining adaptive management techniques, perfect working conditions, and the best industry practices. Unlike most businesses, Alisa is famous for easily establishing trusting relationships with the Kyiv government and her competitors, which helped her get more investments and business partners to engage in new projects.</p>

                        <p>After the <a href="#">Ukraine-US minerals deal</a>, Ukrainian companies mining copper had to pay 50% of their revenue to the reconstruction fund, thus raising their prices. The protagonist understands that if they continue buying this overpriced copper, they will have to raise their prices on FPVs and lose their contract with the government. </p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>Having vast connections in the FPV industry, Alisa invited a few copper factory owners and Kyiv City mayor, <a href="#">Artem Som</a>, for dinner in a nice restaurant. After lengthy negotiations, she proposed that businesses and the Kyiv City administration create a joint initiative, paid for by the mentioned businesses, to plan and renovate an abandoned building into a copper recycling center. In exchange, the companies would get the recycled copper for free. Artem Som happily agreed to this initiative, later stating: "I was happy to finally get a practical idea on recycling, so I gave them the green light." Over the next few weeks, Alisa persuaded the businesses to agree, too, which marked the start of the Kyiv Joint Copper Initiative.</p>

                        <p>The C-level management team of the project at first consisted of five people: Alisa Melnyk as the project lead; Artem Koval, the Kyiv government environmental consultant; <a href="#">Andrii Polishchuk</a>, the sustainability engineer; Serhiy Gorod and Oksana Mohyla, factory owners as business consultants.<sup>[2]</sup>

                        <p>The team researches to determine which waste there is the most copper; they create the center in a renovated abandoned factory and establish the supply chain, building teams of waste collectors and signing contracts with big retailers like <a href="#">Silpo</a> to send their copper waste to the center.

                        <h3>Collecting copper waste from retailers</h3>
                        <p>The initiative team asked the retailers to encourage people to leave their copper waste in special containers inside the shops. Also, people could save money on buying electronics by giving their old electronics (with copper) for delivery to the center instead.</p>

                        <h3>Garbage collecting teams on the ground</h3>
                        <p>To create waste-collectors teams, the KJCI team found people experienced in this: people without homes, pensioners, and others with low income. Kyiv city offered them relatively large pay and social welfare benefits, becoming the experienced core of new teams. High wages for vulnerable populations contributed to the social egalitarianism part of the project. Kyiv City also offered contracts and seasonal opportunities for garbage collecting, with good financial bonuses for people from other areas, including foreign citizens.</p>

                        <p>The recycling center for this initiative, Copper Recycling Center, was based in a long-abandoned factory. This solution allowed the team to save money and time by accessing existing facilities. The team also planned, established, and renovated, simultaneously taking care of the other parts of the project. Even though some cautiously approached using the old facility, Alisa highlighted that "using the old is at the heart of the initiative."</p>

                        <p>The initiative turned out to be a tremendous success. The copper waste levels had dropped significantly, and the business people were delighted to see the profit numbers in their quarterly reports. Thus, the businesses and the mayor started to plan to expand it to other materials. Notably, the founding companies' reputations had risen in Ukraine and Europe, attracting more investors for the scaling of this project.</p>

                        <p>For over 50 years, the world has been shaped by the circular production trend. Alisa Melnyk's introduction of the Copper Initiative laid the foundations for most modern economies. The circular economies of the countries help humanity be more sustainable and save money to spend on other vital branches. As with copper in Kyiv, humanity uses most of its materials today from secondary sources that are already recycled. We help the economy by spending less money on extracting materials. And we help the environment, as we generate less waste. And we support society as recycling creates both intellectual and manual labor jobs.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
